### 🧭 Current Focus
- 🎯 Hands-on learning in **Microsoft Intune**, **Entra ID**, and **M365**  
- ☁️ Preparing for **PL-900** (Power Platform Fundamentals)
- 💡 Exploring **ethical AI** and how technology can serve human flourishing

### ☃️ What Drives Me
I believe technology should be **humane, ethical, and empowering** —  
a tool to help communities thrive, not just systems run.  
This career pivot isn’t just a change of tools; it’s an extension of purpose.
